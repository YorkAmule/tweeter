# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

## Features

Through this Twitter clone, we have all the features regular Twitter has.  We are able to upload tweets, and retrieve them from the database.  The web page also adapts to multiple screen sizes.

We have the tweet area here:
!["Tweet area"]("https://github.com/YorkAmule/tweeter/blob/master/docs/tweet_area.png?raw=true")

As well as the profile image here:
!["Profile Image"]("https://github.com/YorkAmule/tweeter/blob/master/docs/profile.png")

Here is the difference between a hovered tweet and a non-hovered tweet.
!["Hovered Tweet"]("https://github.com/YorkAmule/tweeter/blob/master/docs/highlighted_tweet.png")
!["Non-Hovered Tweet"]("https://github.com/YorkAmule/tweeter/blob/master/docs/regular_tweet.png")



## Known issues

One issue lies within the tweeting itself. While the tweet is able to be sent and retrieved without the webpage refreshing, should one tweet multiple times, it will load the same tweet at an exponential rate.



## Dependencies

- Express
